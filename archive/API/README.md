**XBox2 Data Transformation**

This class can transform tdms files of the xbox2 test stand (located at /eos/project/m/ml-for-alarm-system/private/CLIC_data_transfert/CLIC_DATA_Xbox2_T24PSI_2).

The output files have to be in the following format: _TODO draw.io of output format_

The old transformation code was called API.py and can be found in the old branch.

The new transformation is done in a class structure that can be adapted to work on another XBox stand too.
